    description: 'Field containing a media query in json format. There can be 5 types
      of input:  A radio station like this: {"media_id": "NPO radio 1", "media_type":
      "radio" }. Just an artist like this: {"media_id": "artist name", "media_type":
      "artist"}. An album by an artist like this: {"media_id": "album name", "media_type":"album",
      "artist": "artist name"}. A track by an artist like this: {"media_id":"track
      name", "media_type":"track", "artist": "artist name"}. Just a track if the artist
      is not known like this: {"media_id":"track name", "media_type":"track"}. The
      media_id and media_type are mandatory!

      Examples: - if the input is "Hells Bells by ACDC", the media_query field should
      contain:  {"media_id":"Hells Bells", "media_type":"track", "artist":"AC/DC"}
      - if the input is "NPO Radio een", the media_query will be: {"media_id": "NPO
      Radio 1", "media_type": "radio"} Do only provide data in the given JSON format
      in this field!'
alias: Listen to music or radio
description: 'This script can be used to listen to music or radio on the speaker.
  Here is the structured JSON that is required in the media_query field: {"media_id":"name",  "media_type":"type",
  "artist":"name", "album":"name"}

  In case it is needed, the optional properties "artist" and "album" of the media
  query field can be used to further restrict the search. E.g., if the input is "Hells
  Bells by ACDC", then the output should be  {"media_id":"Hells Bells",  "media_type":"track",
  "artist":"AC/DC"}'
